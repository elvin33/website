            <h3 class="topic">Apple stock prediction</h3>
            <p class="description">In my portfolio, I highlight my work on the Apple stock prediction project. This project 
                involved analyzing historical data of Apple stock prices and developing a machine learning model to forecast future 
                price trends. By applying advanced time series analysis techniques, data preprocessing, and feature engineering, 
                I created a robust predictive model that accurately predicted the movement of Apple stock. This project showcased my 
                expertise in financial data analysis, machine learning algorithms, and model evaluation. Through this project, 
                I demonstrated my ability to derive actionable insights from financial data and make informed predictions for effective 
                investment decision-making.

            <p class="description">
                In my portfolio, I proudly feature my participation in the Kaggle Titanic Machine Learning competition. 
                This engaging data science challenge involved predicting the survival outcomes of passengers on the RMS Titanic using machine learning techniques. 
                Leveraging my expertise in data analysis, feature engineering, and model selection, I developed a robust predictive model that 
                accurately determined whether a passenger survived or not. This experience allowed me to demonstrate my proficiency in handling real-world datasets, 
                applying advanced analytics, and utilizing machine learning algorithms to extract meaningful insights. Through this competition, 
                I showcased my ability to tackle complex data problems and deliver impactful results.
